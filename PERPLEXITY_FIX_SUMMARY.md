# 🔧 Perplexity Response Fix - Summary

## 🐛 Problems Identified:

1. **Long Responses** - Perplexity returned 2000+ chars, then LLM rewrote it → 3000+ chars
2. **Double Processing** - Perplexity answer → LLM → Double the length
3. **No Real Data** - LLM was rewriting Perplexity's factual data

## ✅ Solutions Implemented:

### 1. **Direct Return for Perplexity Answers** ✅
- When Perplexity returns an answer, it's returned **DIRECTLY** without LLM processing
- Saves time (no LLM call)
- Preserves real-time data
- Shorter responses

### 2. **Length Limiting** ✅
- Perplexity answers limited to **600 chars** max
- Truncated at sentence boundary (not mid-word)
- Prevents overly long responses

### 3. **Better Prompt** ✅
- Added system prompt to Perplexity: "Provide concise, accurate answers"
- Limited to 800 tokens max
- Lower temperature (0.2) for factual responses

### 4. **Citation Formatting** ✅
- Citations shown compactly (top 3 only)
- Links formatted as markdown
- Cleaner presentation
