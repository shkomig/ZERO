## Executive Summary

Local AI models (LLMs) don't inherently have internet access. To give them this capability, you must build a **tooling layer** that fetches external information and injects it into the model's context. This research covers three primary architectures, their tradeoffs, best tools, and production deployment strategies.

**Key Finding**: The choice between approaches depends on your use case. Real-time search is simplest for quick queries; RAG pipelines excel at domain knowledge; agent-based systems handle complex, multi-step reasoning.

---

## Core Approaches

### 1. Real-Time Search (Lightweight, Fast)

**How It Works**: Search → Fetch → Extract → Inject → Generate

At query time, the system:
- Queries a search engine (DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI, Exa)
- Downloads and renders target pages (handling JavaScript with Playwright)
- Extracts main content, metadata, dates, and authors
- Injects content directly into the LLM's context window
- LLM generates a response with citations

**Best For**:
- Current events, weather, breaking news
- One-off factual queries
- Demos and prototypes
- Applications without storage budget
- Privacy-focused workflows (no persistent storage)

**Advantages**:
- Stateless (no vector database)
- Always fresh information
- Low infrastructure overhead
- Quick to prototype (1-2 weeks)
- Works offline after fetch

**Disadvantages**:
- High latency (search + fetch + generation)
- No multi-document understanding
- Doesn't benefit from repeated queries
- Limited for complex knowledge domains

**Typical Stack**:
```
User Query
  ↓
DuckDuckGo/SerpAPI/Exa Search
  ↓
Playwright (JavaScript rendering)
  ↓
Content Extraction (BeautifulSoup/Jina)
  ↓
LM Studio / Ollama (Local LLM)
  ↓
Response with Citations
```

### 2. RAG Pipeline (Semantic Understanding, Production)

**How It Works**: Search → Fetch → Extract → Embed → Store → Retrieve → Generate

Once set up, the system:
- Pre-crawls and fetches documents (Crawl4AI, Firecrawl)
- Extracts and chunks text
- Generates vector embeddings
- Stores embeddings in a vector database (Chroma, Qdrant, Weaviate)
- At query time: semantic search finds relevant chunks → LLM synthesizes answer with citations

**Best For**:
- Internal knowledge bases
- Customer support automation
- Domain-specific Q&A (medical, legal, technical docs)
- Repeated queries over same dataset
- Applications requiring semantic understanding across many documents
- Building search-enhanced applications

**Advantages**:
- Semantic understanding (finds nuanced matches)
- Fast response times (pre-indexed)
- Handles large document collections
- Better accuracy for repeated queries
- Supports document-level tracking and citations
- Scalable to thousands of documents

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher setup complexity (3-8 weeks)
- Persistent storage required (database costs)
- Stale by design (only refreshed on re-crawl)
- Requires infrastructure (Kubernetes for scale)
- Token budgeting becomes critical
- Embedding models require GPU/CPU

**Typical Stack**:
```
Document Sources (URLs, PDFs, APIs)
  ↓
Crawl4AI / Firecrawl (Fetch & Parse)
  ↓
Text Chunking & Metadata Extraction
  ↓
Embedding Model (OpenAI, Ollama embeddings)
  ↓
Vector Database (Qdrant / Weaviate)
  ↓
User Query
  ↓
Vector Search (Semantic Retrieval)
  ↓
LM Studio / Ollama + Retrieved Chunks
  ↓
Response with Document Citations
```

### 3. Agent-Based with Tools (Reasoning & Autonomy)

**How It Works**: LLM → Reason → Plan → Select Tools → Execute → Update Context

The LLM decides which tools to use:
- Model evaluates the query and plans steps
- Chooses between web search, calculator, database query, API call, etc.
- Executes tools and receives results
- Updates its internal context and reasoning
- Repeats until task complete or confidence threshold met

**Best For**:
- Multi-step reasoning (planning, research, then answering)
- Complex workflows with decision trees
- Tasks requiring tool selection (when to search vs. use local DB)
- Autonomous workflows with fallback logic
- Dynamic adaptation to query complexity
- Future-proof systems (tools can be added without model retraining)

**Advantages**:
- Flexible (tools added at runtime)
- Intelligent tool selection
- Scales from simple to complex tasks
- Supports reasoning traces (transparency)
- Can combine multiple information sources
- Works with both local and cloud models

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher latency (multiple model calls)
- Cost overhead (multiple API calls)
- Requires tool API definitions
- Debugging complex decision chains is hard
- Hallucinations in tool calls still possible
- Needs guardrails to prevent infinite loops

**Typical Stack**:
```
User Query
  ↓
LLM (FastAPI-served Ollama / LM Studio)
  ↓
Tool Router (via Function Calling or MCP)
  ├─→ Web Search (Tavily / Exa)
  ├─→ Vector DB Query (Qdrant)
  ├─→ SQL Database
  ├─→ REST API Call
  └─→ File System
  ↓
Context Update + Reasoning
  ↓
Repeat (if needed)
  ↓

```

## Architecture Components

### Model Runners (Serving Your LLM)

| Tool | Type | Best For | GPU? | Ease |
|------|------|----------|------|------|
| **LM Studio** | Desktop + API | Rapid prototyping, MCP support | Yes | Very Easy |
| **Ollama** | CLI + REST API | Server deployments | Yes | Easy |
| **vLLM** | Inference engine | High throughput, many users | Yes | Hard |
| **llama.cpp** | C++ library | Minimal deps, CPU-only | Optional | Hard |
| **Jan** | ChatGPT-like UI | Non-technical users | Yes | Very Easy |

**For your use case**: LM Studio (with MCP) or Ollama (via FastAPI wrapper) are ideal. Both support your RTX 5090 and integrate well with Python/FastAPI.

---

### API Integration Methods

#### Traditional REST API
- **Pros**: Simple, language-agnostic, well-understood
- **Cons**: No tool discovery, hardcoded endpoints, stateless by nature
- **Use**: Integrating existing web services

#### Function Calling (Agent-Based)
- **Pros**: LLM decides which tool to call; clear decision traces
- **Cons**: Tools hardcoded at design time; no dynamic discovery
- **Use**: Agents with known toolsets (OpenAI Assistants, Claude)

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP) ⭐ **Recommended for Agents**
- **Pros**: Dynamic discovery, self-describing tools, standardized, AI-native
- **Cons**: New, smaller ecosystem, learning curve
- **Use**: Future-proof systems; LM Studio now supports MCP natively (June 2025+)
- **Example**: MCP server exposes "search_web" → LLM discovers it → uses as needed

**MCP vs REST**: MCP is REST's evolution for AI. Instead of hardcoded endpoints, the LLM asks "what can you do?" and the server responds with a list of capabilities. LLM picks tools dynamically.

#### Streaming APIs
- **Pros**: Real-time data, continuous updates, high throughput
- **Cons**: Complex to manage, state tracking needed
- **Use**: Market data, live dashboards, continuous monitoring

### Web Scraping & Content Extraction

**Three Approaches**:

1. **Lightweight Fetch**: HTTP GET only (fastest, no JS execution)
   - Tools: `requests`, `httpx`
   - Latency: ~200ms
   - Best for: Static HTML, APIs, news feeds

2. **JavaScript Rendering**: Browser automation (slow, handles SPA)
   - Tools: Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer
   - Latency: ~2-5 seconds
   - Best for: Dynamic SPAs, infinite scroll, React/Vue sites

3. **Managed Service**: Pre-rendered by provider (balanced)
   - Tools: Firecrawl, Crawl4AI (managed version), Bright Data
   - Latency: ~1-3 seconds
   - Best for: Scale, minimal maintenance, token optimization

**Token Optimization**: Firecrawl reduces token count by ~67% through aggressive markdown cleanup. Crawl4AI is optional. This matters for RAG pipelines where you're embedding thousands of documents.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Your Path Based on Requirements

**Start with Real-Time Search if**:
- You need current information (news, weather, stock prices)
- Your queries are one-off or bursty
- Storage is a constraint
- Privacy is critical (no persistent data)
- Budget is minimal

**Graduate to RAG if**:
- You have domain-specific documents (internal KB, SOPs, medical records)
- Users ask repeated questions
- Latency tolerance is mid-to-high (few seconds acceptable)
- You can invest in infrastructure
- Accuracy over freshness matters

**Use Agents if**:
- Queries require multi-step reasoning
- You need to decide *which* information source to use
- Complex workflows with fallback logic
- Long-term system (tools added over time)

---

### 2. FastAPI + Ollama Integration (Your Setup)

**Basic Pattern**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ollama import Client

app = FastAPI()
client = Client(host='http://localhost:11434')

@app.post("/search_and_generate")
async def search_and_generate(query: str):
    # 1. Search the web
    results = await search_tavily(query)
    
    # 2. Fetch content
    content = await fetch_and_extract(results[0]['url'])
    
    # 3. Inject into LLM
    prompt = f"Context:\n{content}\n\nQuestion: {query}"
    response = client.generate(model="deepseek-r1", prompt=prompt)
    
    return {"answer": response, "sources": results}
```

**For Production**: Wrap with async operations, add caching, implement retry logic, set timeouts.

---

### 3. Security & Compliance (Critical for Production)

**Network Security**:
- Bind Ollama to `127.0.0.1:11434` by default (not `0.0.0.0`)
- Use ngrok only for development (never production)
- For production: nginx reverse proxy with OAuth2 + TLS
- Implement rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- Monitor outbound requests (prevent data exfiltration)

**Data Handling**:
- Don't train on sensitive data; use RAG instead
- Apply RBAC (role-based access control)
- Encrypt embeddings and vectors at rest
- Log all requests (audit trail)
- Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall) for production

**Model Security**:
- Use verified model hashes (check Hugging Face signatures)
- Run models in containers/sandboxes to limit damage
- Apply input validation (detect prompt injections)
- Monitor outputs for sensitive data leakage
- Use guardrails (content filters, jailbreak detection)

**Compliance**:
- Document data sources (for legal/copyright)
- Respect robots.txt and terms of service when scraping
- Implement right-to-be-forgotten for RAG systems
- Maintain audit logs for regulated industries (healthcare, finance)

---

### 4. Token Management

**For RAG**:
- Use Firecrawl to reduce token load by ~67%
- Chunk documents (~500 tokens per chunk)
- Store metadata (URL, date, author) separately
- Pre-filter to top-K most relevant chunks (5-10 usually enough)
- Monitor embedding costs (depends on model: OpenAI ~$0.02M tokens, local Ollama = free but slower)

**For Real-Time Search**:
- Extract only main content (remove nav, ads, sidebars)
- Use jina.ai reader or similar for clean extraction
- Limit to top 2-3 results (law of diminishing returns)
- Cache results for 1-5 minutes to avoid re-fetching

---

### 5. Scaling Considerations

**Single User / Prototype**:
- LM Studio (GUI) or Ollama (CLI)
- Local search (DuckDuckGo)
- No database needed

**Small Team / MVP** (1-100 users):
- Ollama behind FastAPI
- Redis for caching (optional)
- Vector DB (Chroma, lightweight)
- Rate limit at application level

**Production / Scale** (100+ users):
- Multiple Ollama instances behind load balancer (vLLM recommended)
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Managed vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud)
- Firecrawl for scraping (managed service)
- Use MCP if you have many tools
- Implement circuit breakers and fallback chains

---

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 or similar
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse (e.g., 10 requests/min per user)
- [ ] **Caching**: Redis for frequently asked questions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if search fails
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics (latency, error rate, token usage)
