# 🚀 Quick Fix - Restart Required!

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

1. **Perplexity answers return DIRECTLY** (no LLM rewrite)
2. **Length limited to 600 chars** (not 2000+)
3. **Better prompt** for factual, concise data
4. **Real-time data preserved** with citations

## 🔧 What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Stop API Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `api_server.py`

### Step 2: Restart API Server
```bash
python api_server.py
```

### Step 3: Test It
Ask: "latest AI news"

**Expected:**
- Model: `perplexity-ai` (not `fast`)
- Length: ~600 chars (not 2000+)
- Real-time data with citations

## 📊 Before vs After:

### Before (Current):
```
Query: "latest AI news"
→ Model: fast (LLM processed)
→ Length: 1856 chars ❌
→ Generic AI info (not real-time)
```

### After (After Restart):
```
Query: "latest AI news"
→ Model: perplexity-ai ✅
→ Length: ~600 chars ✅
→ Real-time data with dates, facts ✅
→ Citations included ✅
```

## 🔍 How to Verify:

After restarting, you should see in logs:
```
[WebSearch] [OK] Perplexity AI enabled - real-time search active!
[WebSearch] Perplexity AI answer (600 chars) - returning directly
```

If you see this, it's working! ✅
